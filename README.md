# Fitness Linear Progression - VUE

Web app that helps you keep track of your exercise performances so you can improve.

# TODO

**Process when activating a workout:**
- Commit close action for Nav Drawer
- Swap in Workout Toolbar for the App Bar (Can be done with router)
- Replace the following for Toolbar
    - Date >>> Live workout timer
    - App Name >>> Workout Name
    - Menu Btn >>> Cancel button for workout (X)

**Needed Modals:**
- Canceling a workout (X)
- Using home defaults button

**Corrections:**
- Hardcoded workout path (/workout/xxxxx) should be using router to help build
- Update README
